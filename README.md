CoT-Seg is a a training-free framework that rethinks reasoning segmentation by combining chain-of-thought reasoning with self-correction. 
CoT-Seg leverages the inherent reasoning ability of pre-trained MLLMs
(e.g., GPT-4o) to decompose queries into meta-instructions, extract fine-grained
semantics from images, and identify target objects even under implicit or complex
prompts. Crucially, CoT-Seg incorporates a self-correction stage: the model evaluates its own segmentation against the original query and reasoning trace, identifies mismatches, and iteratively refines the mask.

Our code will be released soon.
